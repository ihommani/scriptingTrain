Dummy scripts to train myself on bash.

## move_files.sh
Allow to move matching patterns files to 
a target directory.  
This operation can obviously be done with a simple mv.
The point of this script is to illustrate the use of
 **getopts** and the **variable expansion** through some 
 verification.
